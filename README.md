# Development Challenge:

Using ReactJS you should build a **comments** feature similar to the one on Facebook that supports tagging other users. All the necessary data about the comments will be stored inside a DB accessible through an endpoint provided by AppInChina and all the suggestions of people to tag will be Github users using Github API.

For the purpose of this challenge it’s necessary to build everything **without the usage of any library** other than the ones already included on this repository.

## Details

There should be a text input where any text can be written. Typing the character “@“ will popup the suggestions which will change what is rendered as the user is writing the GitHub username.

To reduce the amount of requests to the GitHub API it’s important to make the request only if the user has not typed anything for at least one second.

Example when typing a username:

It’s important to have the option of navigating between the suggestions when hitting the navigation arrows of the keyboard and hitting the intro button to select besides the option of just clicking the desired option with the cursor.

After a GitHub user is selected the user will be able to continue writing the comment and typing the intro button will save it inside the AppInChina database through the endpoint provided.

Below the text input there will be a list of all the comments. It’s very important that the information stored inside the database records the necessary information from GitHub to later render the comment in a user friendly way as the example image but where the tagged users will be rendered as their name which also functions as a link to their GitHub page when that name is clicked.

Example:

## Extra notes

The id of the comments database table is an int auto-generated by the backend.
The text column of the comments database table has a maximum length of 5000 characters and it’s intended for you to save any information you might need (just keep in mind to store it as a string).
Your *EXAM_ID* will be provided by the AppInChina team.

## Endpoints

*GET* https://hiring.appinchina.co/data/EXAM_ID 
To view all the comments.

*DELETE* https://hiring.appinchina.co/data/EXAM_ID/2345 
To delete the comment with id 2345 (mainly for development purposes)

*POST* https://hiring.appinchina.co/data/EXAM_ID 
To add new comments. The data should be sent as a JSON just like `{"text":"API Test”}`

*GET* https://api.github.com/search/users?q=rich
To search for users containing “rich” inside their GitHub username.
